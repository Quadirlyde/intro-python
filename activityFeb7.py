# READING PROMPTS
# Carefully read through each scenario and determine which Python Operator you would use to build the

# Read the question carfully
# Find key words that you recognized to deduce what it could be
# use context clues provided in the prompt ot deduce what it could be.

# 5. You have been hired as a software engineer to develop a gym membership system.
